## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a modern, layered architecture:

```
Presentation Layer (Components & Pages)
         ↓
State Management Layer (Context & Hooks)
         ↓
Business Logic Layer (Controllers)
         ↓
Data Access Layer (Services & Storage)
```

Key architectural patterns:
- **Component-based architecture**: Reusable, composable components
- **Context API**: Global state management
- **Custom Hooks**: Logic extraction and reuse
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Route and feature protection
- **MVC Pattern**: Models, Controllers, and Views separation

> 📖 For comprehensive architecture details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

---

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Route and feature-level protection
- **Input Validation**: Client-side form validation
- **Protected Routes**: RoleGuard component prevents unauthorized access
- **Secure State Management**: Context providers at application root

> ⚠️ **Note**: Current implementation uses mock data. For production, implement:
> - Backend authentication (JWT, OAuth)
> - Server-side authorization
> - API security
> - Data encryption
> - Audit logging

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production
